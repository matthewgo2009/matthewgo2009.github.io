# About Me

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Research Scientist** at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), hosted by Prof. [Samory Kpotufe](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kp/). My research focuses on the theory of transfer learning.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in 2024, where I was advised by Prof. [Mehrdad Mahdavi](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~mzm616/). Before that, I obtained my B.E. from Soochow University in 2018.

My primary research interest lies in **Collaborative Learning** from heterogeneous data sources, including:
*   Federated Learning
*   Transfer Learning
*   Multi-task Learning

I am also interested in **Optimization** (distributed, minimax, and non-convex optimization) and applying statistical learning theory to understand modern machine learning scenarios, such as LLM pre-training and fine-tuning.
